Like most people, I have back-pocket answers tucked away for the inevitable icebreaker question I'm going to get in my next Zoom meeting or freezing outdoor coffee chat (just WFH + ‚ÄúI just moved to New York and I have no friends" things).
For my I-need-to-sus-out-if-this-person-is-cultured&quirky-enough-to-be-in-my-circle homies, "What's your favorite [_film_](https://twitter.com/oldwitchsring/status/1355246458639888385?s=20)?" is a quintessential vibe-check (along with "What's your favorite Frank [_album_](https://open.spotify.com/album/392p3shh2jkxUxY2VHvlH8?si=TP685vJ-TMK4kTdD-MSqSQ)," but we can unpack that another time).

Inception is my personal trusty back-pocket answer. Sure, this is a fairly boring, basic reply, but that's not the part that bothers me. Rather, I can't articulate why Inception is my favorite film other than "I remember it made me feel some type of way,‚Äù and that's not very sophisticated reasoning. This would also apply when folks asked me for my thoughts on particular books. Another line I'd get tired of reusing in conversation is, "Oh, that reminds me of this podcast I listened to, but I can't remember what it was called/who it was by..."
In 2020, I decided to keep a running list of all the books, films, and podcasts I consumed. This idea is not revolutionary, several platforms exist for this use-case ([Goodreads](https://goodreads.com), [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), respectively... I'll leave out podcasts because tbh no good platform existed at the time). I ultimately decided to use [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) because I didn't want to fragment my internet presence into some weird digital horcruxes. I also coupled this database with a revival of a weekly [What I've Been Reading](https://katiewav.medium.com/) Medium series that I originally started in 2018 to record the best content I consumed every week.



I could insert some pedagogical quote about why keeping track of all of this is useful, but it's really not rocket science... having everything recorded makes it leaps and bounds easier to retrospectively pull material, as well as creates efficient memory markers for notes. Instead, I'll include a much livelier quote from author [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) (s/o to the eternal homie [Nikhil](https://niksethi.com) for introducing me to Sloan, as well as other incredible writers like [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com) and [Nick Cave](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/)):

"For me, it has been extremely important and useful to create space where a bunch of seemingly unrelated material can get loaded into my brain ‚Äì into my own personal RAM ‚Äì and then just hang out in a non-directed, non-goal-oriented way. It can have a chance to stew, simmer, and ferment."

The more fun/crucial part of this whole exercise (and a question I get often) is "Where do I source all this content I'm supposed to be keeping track of?" For books and podcasts, this process is straightforward/it's easier to source by word-of-mouth. For articles, it gets a bit more tricky...

## Sourcing (Twitter, Feedly, Email Newsletters)

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that I source probably ~60% of the articles I read from Twitter ‚Äî the key to getting this to work for you is just by following people/outlets you admire. The next ~25% come from [Feedly](https://feedly.com), which is a platform that allows you to basically collate your favorite sources into one feed.

The last ~15% are newsletters I get in my inbox, a few I follow are: [Maybe Baby](https://haleynahman.substack.com/), [Margins](https://themargins.substack.com/), [From the Desk of Alicia Kennedy](https://www.aliciakennedy.news/), [Newcomer](https://www.newcomer.co/), and plenty more.


## Tracking (Notion)

I've tried a handful of tools for content tracking including [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) and <br/> [are.na](https://are.na), but eventually settled on [Notion](https://notion.so) (no I haven't tried Roam, don't ask me). Basically my process here is to use the Notion Web Clipper to save articles that at first glance look even remotely interesting to a "to/read" page. I'll usually end up with about 30-40 articles in a week.

Then about once or twice a week, I'll sit down, grind through the articles and delete the ones I didn't enjoy. Probably 5 or 6 articles will make it into my weekly What I've Been Reading post. The next week, I'll delete everything in the page and start from scratch. I also have a "best of best" page for the truly incredible pieces I consume, which is currently about ~20 pieces.

In the attention economy where everyone is quite literally fighting for our eyeballs, it's incredibly easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of information out in the world. I often say it's simultaneously the easiest/hardest it's ever been to learn. I'm far from where I want to be in terms of creating a robust learning process that works for me, but I hope that by writing this, I can help you get one step further in whatever that journey may look like for you. As always, I‚Äôm happy to mindshare on favorite thinkers/tools/thoughts in general, [**I'm only a Twitter DM away.**](https://twitter.com/katiewav) üôÇ
